Python implementation of Machine Learning course on Coursera by Stanford University

This is the python implementation of the programming assignment of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. The course requires the programming assignments to be implemented in Octave or Matlab. I have used Jupyter Notebooks for the assignments.
